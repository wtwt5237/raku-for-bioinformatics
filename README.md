Raku/Perl6 Resources for bioinformatics research by Tao Wang

I am a bioinformatics scientist enthusiastic about perl5/perl6/raku. Vist my lab website for more bioinformatics resources: https://qbrc.swmed.edu/labs/wanglab/index.php

## Hello bioinformaticians
 
* Download and install raku: https://perl6.org/downloads/
* Raku tutorial to get you started: I found this tutorial to be very good: https://perl6intro.com/
* Your first raku experience. After you have installed raku, run this in the shell console, and you should get "hello bioinformatics!"
  ```shell
  perl6 -e "'hello bioinformatics!'.say"
  ```
* Your first raku script. Create a script with the name test.p6 using your favorite text editor. Type the following
  ```raku
  #!/usr/bin/env perl6
  my @array[3];
  @array[0]="bioinformatics";
  @array[1]="is";
  @array[2]="awesome!";
  say @array;
  ```
  Execute by running it in the console
  ```shell
  perl6 test.p6
  ```
  And you should get "[bioinformatics is awesome!]"
