I am a bioinformatics scientist enthusiastic about perl5/perl6/raku. Vist my lab website for more bioinformatics resources: https://qbrc.swmed.edu/labs/wanglab/index.php

## Hello bioinformaticians
 
  * Raku tutorial to get you started: I found this tutorial to be very good: https://perl6intro.com/
  * Your first raku program. After you have installed raku, run this in the shell console
  ```shell
